# SerenityOre
Adds just an Ore and an Item to the game, which can be mined for Server Currency

The Ore itself does not Spawn, you can implement it (for example) via Thermal-Foundation to your World.

The Gem-Item drops when mining the Ore without a Silk-Touch pickaxe.

## Supported Game-Version
1.12.2

No, I won't upgrade it. Feel free to fork and do it yourself

## World Gen with COFH
As mentioned you CAN use COFHs world-gen to add these Ores to the world. The example config for COFH is [here](https://github.com/angel-tigercloud/SerenityOre/blob/master/cofh_gen_serenityore.json)

Just drop the config in the /config/cofh/world/ folder and start the game/server, thats all.

You can use other generation tools as well, this is just how I add the ore though.

## Other
Thats my very first Mod so i keept it simple, plus I needed something like this hehe

When you want to use it on your own Server feel free to do
