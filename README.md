# SerenityOre
Adds just an Ore and an Item to the game, which can be mined for Server Currency

The Ore itself does not Spawn, you can implement it (for example) via Thermal-Foundation to your World.

The Gem-Item drops when mining the Ore without a Silk-Touch pickaxe.

## Supported Game-Version
1.12.2
